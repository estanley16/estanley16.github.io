However, there has been limited work on investigating how unfair performance manifests in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods, and how XAI can be used to investigate potential reasons for unfairness. Thus, the aim of this work was to analyze the effects of previously established sociodemographic-related confounders on classifier performance and explainability methods.Approach: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to predict biological sex from T1-weighted brain MRI datasets of 4547 9- to 10-year-old adolescents from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. Performance disparities of the trained CNN between White and Black subjects were analyzed and saliency maps were generated for each subgroup at the intersection of sex and race.Results: The classification model demonstrated a significant difference in the percentage of correctly classified White male (90.3 % ± 1.7 % ) and Black male (81.1 % ± 4.5 % ) children. Conversely, slightly higher performance was found for Black female (89.3 % ± 4.8 % ) compared with White female (86.5 % ± 2.0 % ) children. Saliency maps showed subgroup-specific differences, corresponding to brain regions previously associated with pubertal development. In line with this finding, average pubertal development scores of subjects used in this study were significantly different between Black and White females (p \textless 0.001) and males (p \textless 0.001).Conclusions: We demonstrate that a CNN with significantly different sex classification performance between Black and White adolescents can identify different important brain regions when comparing subgroup saliency maps. Importance scores vary substantially between subgroups within brain structures associated with pubertal development, a race-associated confounder for predicting sex. We illustrate that unfair models can produce different XAI results between subgroups and that these results may explain potential reasons for biased performance.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">MICCAI WS</abbr> </div> <div id="stanley_disproportionate_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Disproportionate Subgroup Impacts and Other Challenges of Fairness in Artificial Intelligence for Medical Image Analysis</div> <div class="author"> <em>Emma A.

However, bias mitigation strategies to achieve group fairness have appreciable shortcomings, which may pose ethical limitations in clinical settings. In this work, we study a well-defined case example of a deep learning-based medical image analysis model exhibiting unfairness between racial subgroups. Specifically, with the task of sex classification using tabulated data from 6,276 T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 9–10 year old adolescents, we investigate how adversarial debiasing for equalized odds between White and Black subgroups affects performance of other structured and intersectional subgroups. Although the debiasing process was successful in reducing classification performance disparities between White and Black subgroups, accuracies for the highest performing subgroups were substantially degraded and disproportionate impacts on performance were seen when considering intersections of sex, race, and socioeconomic status. These results highlight one of the several challenges when attempting to define and achieve algorithmic fairness, particularly in medical imaging applications.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Journal</abbr> </div> <div id="stanley_towards_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Towards objective and systematic evaluation of bias in artificial intelligence for medical imaging</div> <div class="author"> <em>Emma A.

However, since not all sources of bias in real-world medical imaging data are easily identifiable, it is challenging to comprehensively assess their impacts. In this article, we introduce an analysis framework for systematically and objectively investigating the impact of biases in medical images on AI models.Our framework utilizes synthetic neuroimages with known disease effects and sources of bias. We evaluated the impact of bias effects and the efficacy of 3 bias mitigation strategies in counterfactual data scenarios on a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier.The analysis revealed that training a CNN model on the datasets containing bias effects resulted in expected subgroup performance disparities. Moreover, reweighing was the most successful bias mitigation strategy for this setup. Finally, we demonstrated that explainable AI methods can aid in investigating the manifestation of bias in the model using this framework.The value of this framework is showcased in our findings on the impact of bias scenarios and efficacy of bias mitigation in a deep learning model pipeline. This systematic analysis can be easily expanded to conduct further controlled in silico trials in other investigations of bias in medical imaging AI.Our novel methodology for objectively studying bias in medical imaging AI can help support the development of clinical decision-support tools that are robust and responsible.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Journal</abbr> </div> <div id="stanley_where_2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Where, why, and how is bias learned in medical image analysis models?

This study aims to bridge this knowledge gap by studying where, why, and how biases from medical images are encoded in these models. Methods We systematically studied layer-wise bias encoding in a convolutional neural network for disease classification using synthetic brain magnetic resonance imaging data with known disease and bias effects. We quantified the degree to which disease-related information, as well as morphology-based and intensity-based biases were represented within the learned features of the model. Findings Although biases were encoded throughout the model, a stronger encoding did not necessarily lead to the model using these biases as a shortcut for disease classification. We also observed that intensity-based effects had a greater influence on shortcut learning compared to morphology-based effects when multiple biases were present. Interpretation We believe that these results constitute an important first step towards a deeper understanding of algorithmic bias in deep learning models trained using medical imaging data. This study also showcases the benefits of utilising controlled, synthetic bias scenarios for objectively studying the mechanisms of shortcut learning.

However, counterfactual images, which can be generated by causal generative models (CGMs), are inherently hypothetical—raising questions of how to properly validate that they are realistic and accurately reflect the intended modifications. A common approach for quantitatively evaluating CGM-generated counterfactuals involves using a discriminative model as a ‘pseudo-oracle’ to assess whether interventions on specific variables are effective. However, this method is not well-suited for in-depth error identification and analysis of CGMs. To address this limitation, we propose to leverage synthetic, ‘ground truth’ counterfactual datasets as a novel approach for debugging and evaluating CGMs. These synthetic datasets enable the computation of global performance metrics and precise localization of CGM failure modes. To further quantify failures, we introduce a novel metric, the Triangulation of Effectiveness and Amplification (TEA), which precisely quantifies the effectiveness of target variable interventions and the additional amplification of unintended effects. We test and validate our evaluation framework on two state-of-the-art CGMs where the results demonstrate the utility of synthetic datasets in identifying failure modes of CGMs, and highlight the potential of the proposed TEA metric as a robust tool for evaluation of their performance.

In this work, we investigated how size and separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on imaging manufacturer) or non-separable ‘pseudo-subgroups’. We found that simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance, with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="social"> <div class="contact-icons"> <a href="mailto:%79%6F%75@%65%78%61%6D%70%6C%65.%63%6F%6D" title="email"><i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a> <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1010907" title="Inspire HEP" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-inspire"></i></a> <a href="/feed.xml" title="RSS Feed"><i class="fa-solid fa-square-rss"></i></a> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qc6CJjYAAAAJ" title="Google Scholar" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-google-scholar"></i></a> <a href="https://www.alberteinstein.com/" title="Custom Social" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> <img src="https://www.alberteinstein.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cropped-favicon-192x192.png" alt="Custom Social"> </a> </div> <div class="contact-note"></div> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Emma Stanley.
